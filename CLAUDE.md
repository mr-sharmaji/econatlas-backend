# econatlas-backend

FastAPI Python backend. Production: https://api.velqon.xyz (OpenAPI docs at `/docs`).

## Layout
- `app/api/` — FastAPI routes
- `app/services/` — business logic (scrapers, notifications, LLM suggestions)
- `app/queue/` — background job dispatch
- `app/scheduler/` — cron-like job runners
- `app/core/` — shared: `database.py` (DB pool), `settings.py`, `utils.py`
- `app/schemas/` — Pydantic models
- `sql/` — migrations / queries
- `scripts/` — one-off scripts

## Central primitives (god nodes — read these first)
- `app/core/database.py::get_pool()` — **every DB code path** goes through this. 169 callers.
- `app/services/scrapers/base.py::BaseScraper` — all scrapers inherit this.
- `app/core/utils.py::record_to_dict`, `_run_with_retry`, `parse_ts`
- `app/core/settings.py::get_settings()`

## Working efficiently (reduce tokens)
Before opening files, query the pre-built knowledge graph:

```bash
graphify query "<question>"            # BFS over graph.json, ~2k tokens
graphify explain "<node>"              # explain a function/class and its neighbors
graphify path "<A>" "<B>"              # shortest connection between two symbols
```

Graph lives at `graphify-out/graph.json` (not committed — regenerate with `graphify update .`).

Prefer `graphify query` over wide `grep` / reading many files. Fall back to Read only for the specific files the graph points to.

## Stack
Python 3.10+, FastAPI, asyncpg (Postgres), Redis, Firebase, Docker, Prometheus + Grafana.

## Conventions
- Async everywhere; DB access via `get_pool()`.
- Logging: structured; see `logs/` (gitignored).
- Secrets: `.env` + `firebase-key.json` (both gitignored).
- Never edit `graphify-out/` — it's a generated artifact.

## Debug & Ops Runbook
Production API: `https://api.velqon.xyz` (open, no auth currently).

**DB (read `docs/db_schema.md` first — 37 tables, 504 columns snapshot):**
```bash
curl -sS -X POST https://api.velqon.xyz/ops/sql \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"SELECT ... LIMIT 50"}'
```
Always add `LIMIT`. Filter by `created_at > now() - interval '1 hour'` for recent state.

**Logs — default filter to errors + a window + limit:**
```bash
curl -sS 'https://api.velqon.xyz/ops/logs?level=error&since=1h&limit=200'
```
Only widen (INFO, 24h) if error logs show nothing relevant. Never pull unbounded.

**Jobs:** `GET /ops/jobs`, `GET /ops/jobs/running`, `POST /ops/jobs/trigger/{name}`, `POST /ops/jobs/abort/{name}`.

**Grafana dashboards** (`https://api.velqon.xyz/grafana/d/<uid>`):
- `econatlas-v2` — overall monitor
- `econatlas-api-perf` — API latency + error rate
- `econatlas-external` — external API health
- `econatlas-jobs` — job + pipeline status
- `econatlas-system` — host, DB, Redis

**Debug order (follow this to avoid wandering):**
1. `graphify query "<what is broken>"` — locate relevant subgraph, don't Read/Grep yet.
2. `/ops/logs?level=error&since=1h` — is it already logged?
3. `/ops/sql` against the relevant table (check `docs/db_schema.md` first).
4. Open only the specific files graphify pointed to. Confirm the hypothesis before editing.
5. Check Grafana only when metrics (latency, throughput) are the question.

## Planning gate (cuts rework)
For any change touching >1 file or >50 lines: state the approach as 3–5 bullets and wait for "go" before editing. Saves the "wrong logic, redo" loop.

## graphify

This project has a graphify knowledge graph at graphify-out/.

Rules:
- Before answering architecture or codebase questions, read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md for god nodes and community structure
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, navigate it instead of reading raw files
- After modifying code files in this session, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost)
